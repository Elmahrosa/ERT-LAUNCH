# ERT Whitepaper: Ultra High-Tech Stablecoin for Egypt's Digital Pharaohs

## Abstract
$ERT is a USD-pegged stablecoin (1:1) on Solana, over-collateralized at 150% by $TEOS (core token), physical gold (via tokenized reserves), and RWAs (e.g., healthcare at Salma Unity Care Hospital, smart city projects). Total supply: 100B $ERT. Peg stability via Pyth oracles, ZK privacy (Light Protocol), AI audits (GPT-4), and 5-level mining rewards.

## Tokenomics
- **Supply**: 100B fixed (no inflation post-launch).
- **Distribution**: 40% Reserves, 30% Mining Rewards, 20% Liquidity/DeFi, 10% Team/Governance (vested 2yrs).
- **Backing**: 50% $TEOS, 30% Gold (XAU/USD via oracles), 20% RWAs (hospital services tokenized).
- **Fees**: 0.1% mint/burn (to reserves); 0.5% transfer (DAO treasury).
- **Burn Mechanism**: Auto-burn if collateral <120% (AI-triggered).

## Stability & Tech
- **Peg**: Automated via `peg_adjust.js` (Pyth prices; adjust if >1% deviation).
- **Privacy**: ZK proofs for reserves (prove >=150% without revealing holdings).
- **Mining**: Stake $ERT for 1% APY + 0.5%/level (max 5); referrals on-chain.
- **Governance**: Multisig (3/5 threshold) for upgrades; future DAO.
- **Risks**: Oracle failure (mitigated by confidence checks), market volatility (over-collateral).

## Roadmap
- Q1 2025: Devnet launch, Telegram bot.
- Q2: Mainnet, Raydium liquidity.
- Q3: Cross-chain (Wormhole), AI enhancements.
- Q4: RWA integrations (hospital payments).
